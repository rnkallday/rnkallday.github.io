                <p class="mb-8">I tell stories—some with words, some with music, all with intent. As a writer, musician, and advocate for AI literacy, I stand at the crossroads of tradition and progress, watching the world evolve and dragging the skeptics along for the ride. My work spans a wide range—from art and culture to AI—and you’ll find it published in places that care about such things.</p>

                <p class="mb-8">I’ve washed dishes with ex-convicts, raised millions for the arts, and learned that the only real job security is curiosity. I don’t believe AI can steal your soul, but I’m certain it can make you forget you had one. I write to remind you of this.</p>

                <p>I’m that guy with the untamed mohawk and worn-in 501s on the morning train. I’ll also be that guy you swear you know from somewhere, standing in a finely tailored tux at the opera tonight. And when you blink during your double take, you might just see yourself reflected in my work.</p>
